I’m a Computer Science student at Can Tho University with a strong interest in software development and AI applications. I enjoy building practical projects such as pet-matching websites, AI-powered chatbots, and interactive games like Snake with intelligent behavior.

I’m passionate about understanding how things work under the hood — from operating systems and computer networks to algorithms and database design. I like writing clean, structured code and often challenge myself to solve problems without relying on built-in libraries.

Outside of coding, I stay active through badminton and gym workouts, and I enjoy exploring tech tips, digital design, and fun life hacks.
